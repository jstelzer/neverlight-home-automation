# Remaining work.

* See https://academy.networkchuck.com/blog/local-ai-voice-assistant

* The docker compose stack:

wire up webcam more permanently on linux box

home-assistant (share the tcp socket globally)

wyoming-satalite protocol

ollama (enable gpu)

iphone (get app working)


* Notes

After looking at the AUR stuff I think I really, really want this to all be a docker-compose file.
Its easier to share, will break less stuff and wont fuck with the system python.
